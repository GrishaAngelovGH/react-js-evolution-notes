The **React Labs update** introduces exciting experimental features, including **View Transitions** and **Activity Components**, aimed at improving UI performance and interactivity.  

### **Key Features in the Update:**  
- **View Transitions API** ‚Äì Enables **smooth animations** between UI states, making transitions more fluid.  
- **Activity Components** ‚Äì A new way to **manage state and interactions**, simplifying complex UI behaviors.  
- **Performance Enhancements** ‚Äì Optimizations to **reduce re-renders** and improve responsiveness.  

These features are still **experimental**, but they signal React‚Äôs continued focus on **better animations, state management, and developer experience**.

There are two different concepts at play here:

1. **View Transitions API (CSS-based)**: This is a browser-level feature that enables smooth animations when transitioning between different views. React is integrating this API through new components, allowing developers to easily apply transitions without manually managing CSS animations.

2. **React Transitions (State Prioritization)**: This is a React feature that lets developers mark state updates as **low priority**, meaning they won‚Äôt block urgent interactions. Previously, all state updates were treated as urgent, but now developers can defer UI changes to enhance performance.

While both concepts help improve UI transitions, they work at different layers‚Äî**one is about animations (CSS), the other is about rendering performance (React state updates)**. React is making it easier to use both seamlessly.

React‚Äôs use of `startTransition` in two different contexts can make things feel unnecessarily tangled!

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:
- **Originally (`startTransition`)**: It was introduced to control **state update priority**, allowing developers to mark updates as low-priority so UI interactions remain smooth.
- **Now (`startTransition` with View Transitions)**: React also integrates the **View Transitions API**, a browser feature for handling animated page transitions, and somehow chose to **reuse the same function name (`startTransition`)**.

### Why would React do this?
The logic is that both cases deal with **transitions**‚Äîone in terms of **rendering priority**, the other in **visual animations**. Since View Transitions often involve state updates (like changing a page view), React is leveraging `startTransition` to manage both at once.

### How does it work in View Transitions?
In this new use case, `startTransition` helps:
1. **Trigger a View Transition** when switching UI states.
2. **Ensure smooth rendering**, allowing animations to play while React efficiently updates the DOM.
